# D-Crowdfunding
A decentralised crowdfunding app.


## Why?
Crowdfunding is basically a person/company/organisation getting funds from people for various reasons like charity, for their project, business, etc. But the problem in the current process is people who are donating would not know if the funds being collected is used for the cause mentioned.

To solve this issue, we introduce a decentralised method for crowdfunding. The manager who represents the company sets a few goals like why they need the money, the deadline for the fund-raiser, minimum contribution required to be part of crowdfunding. 

Here, the crowd instead of donating directly to the hands of the manager the fund is given to a smart contract created by the company. Now, to pull the funds from the smart contract the manager would need to take permission from the crowd(kinda like voting) and if 50% of the crowd agrees then only the funds can be withdrawn else it's not possible.

If incase the target(money required) is not met by the deadline the crowd can withdraw their money from the smart contract.
